	My PeerChat project contains two Android applications. One is to run the server and the other is to run the client so they can be connected.  The server app needs to be started, and then once started, the client is about to start by connection to the server with the provided IP address and port number.  Once a connection is made, both the server and the client are able to send messages to each other until the server app user stops the server.  
	I created the Application interfaces using Java and for the button functions I called the JNI portion which was written in C++. The server performs the necessary calls to start up the server(socket, bind, listen, accept). While the server is waiting for a connection from the client, the accept call blocks any further execution of the server code.  I also used the BaseTask class which is an embedded class in BaseActivity.  The BaseTask class extends the thread class and thus performs synchronization in the Java side by overriding the start and run functions.
	The problems I ran into were mostly debugging issues and difficulty in getting the NDK to work as I would have liked.  Android development in general has a learning curve.  I found it hard getting used to work with all of the different components required to build the interface of the application.  The NDK install and setup instructions on the NDK portion of the project also troubled me because it was hard trying to find out which parts of my code had bugs.  It was a pain going through the code line by line trying to find errors.
	Overall, this project had really made me understand Android development and I am surprised that I am able to apply what I have learned in systems programming to create a real-world Android application using NDK.
