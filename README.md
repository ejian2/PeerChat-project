=====================
With thousands of useful apps on the app store, the mobile phone app market is burgeoning at a rapid rate. Mobile users frequently download a new appealing app and soon forget about it. As a result, the device quickly runs out of storage space. Additionally, with the surge of mobile apps operating on multimedia content such as WhatsApp, users share large pictures, videos, and audio files that makes the problem worse. Clean-up apps are available, but they remove both the unused apps and the useful data collected by that app. Many users uninstall applications or move photos and videos to other Cloud-based storage; recent iOS8 installation is an example of this. This exhausting of space requires users to upgrade mobile phones very frequently. However, users pay $100 more for 2x increase in deviceâ€™s storage capacity. We propose, instead, to have a smart file system to track rarely used bulky apps and move their data to a private or public Cloud storage. If the user accesses one of these clouded-out apps, the data will be downloaded on the mobile phone. Execution can start early even when the app is only partially downloaded. We call this streaming of apps, which saves the user the cost of download over cellular networks by fetching only relevant portions of the app. We could also provide an option to download the app only on WiFi next time WiFi is available, and cheaply prefetch larger data items to a close-by cloudlet.
